        <h2 style="text-align: center;color:azure;">From databases to design:HTML, CSS and SQL</h2>
        <p style="color:azure;margin: 10px 20px;"> Week 2 was the first step to the world of back end development. We started the week off
            learning
            about different databases, making different kidns and using SQL queries to retrieve specific data.
            Alongside the back-end side we continued to work on the front-end side creating webpages using HTML
            and introducing style with CSS. Implementing this knowledge gave me the vital knowledge to create a basic
            structual webpage, and it was the start of this journal. </p>
