            This week we were given a big project in the <b>frontend</b> side. We had to build a text-based
            escape room collabrotaively within groups using inqueriers to get user inputs, functions and classes
            and subclasses. Firstly, we thought of an idea and created a user flow chart to map it out.
            <img src="./images/userflow.png"><br>
            We then started the development process. Splitting the work between the group evenly so we
            could all take part in each section. Firstly building the Inqueries and monologues for each room then adding
            a timer, a game loop, promises and ifelse statements.
            We also added different variables and created functions e.g. playAgain so whenevr the
            player chose the wrong option and died they would get the option to play again.
            We created them all in different files and used import to bring all the information back to
            one script.js file.

            <!--show end result escape room here then move onto back end. create a border around front and backend.-->
        </p>
        <p style="color: white; text-align: center; margin:  10px 20px;" id="backendp"> Moving onto the <b>backend</b>
            side
            we downloaded mongoDB and used different queries to make a table and include values. We then pasted a
            cars.json file into mondoDB to practise our queries such as .find and used opertors such as $gte and much
            more.
            MongoDB Atlas was our next download and we were taught how to navigate through the website, considering it
            was quite similiar to
            mongoDB we then created our own vehicles file with a bikes collection and made our own .json file to
            include.
            We added data, retrieved specific data and changed data.</p>
