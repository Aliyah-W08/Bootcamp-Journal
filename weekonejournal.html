            We dove straight into work. downloading differnt softwares and resources that will help
            us
            throughout the course. One that I have used massively throughout the course is vscode. We were taught the
            ins
            and outs of how to use this software and how to diaplay the code we wrote through using differnet commands
            in
            the terminal.
            After downloading eveything we started learning the fundamentals of javascript and used vscode to output
            differnet ideas and things we were taught.
