            During Week 6, we ventured into React on the front-end. We kicked off by getting
            comfortable with JSX syntax within our 'my-app' projects in Visual Studio Code.
            By Friday, we were diving into props, discovering how they resemble HTML attributes.
            Through importing files and employing CSS Flexbox, we pieced together a simple project
            mimicking Netflix's layout.<br> In the backend segment we connected mongoDB to VScode
            and used the folders we had created. The queries we used in compass, we not practised
            in VScode. We got taught the syntax and what each segment means and practised different ones
            e.g. DeleteOne(). On thursday we then created a JSON file in compass, exported it to
            atlas and connected it to VScode. We has a template on the side and used that to create 
            our own different files and did the different queries in VScode. 
            Learning the different softwares and practising what
            we were taught. </p>
