                Coming up to completeing one month of the bootcamp and we are introduced to more
                difficult parts of JavaScript. We started the week of learning about the 2 types of execution contexts,
                global and local. Focusing more on the global we saw different examples of code and had to figure out
                the order of the call stack to understand the execution of code. Staying on the frontend side we
                looked at the difference between global,local and block scopes and higher order functions. We first
                learnt
                the syntax and then how to include functions in functions. OOP (object orirented programming) was next
                and
                we were taught how to do it using the concept of classes, subclasses and objects. We created properties,
                added
                different instances and chained the methods together at the end to get the full result.

            <p style="color: white;margin: 10px 20px">
                Now moving onto the backend side we were given tables and were told to normalise them and give them each
                a
                primary
                key and have one table that would like with the foreign keys. Using SQL queries we would get different
                information
                from the different tables using joins and innerjoins. We then later were given an assignment
                to complete implementing all that we had learnt about SQL.
            </p>
            <p style="color: white; text-align: center;">In the below example we had a table that we had to noralise
                down to 3NF (3 normal form) and
                find the table that would become the linking table to connect all the infomration with the primary
                keys used from the other sables that now become foreign keys.
