        <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center;"> Deeper into Javascript: JSDOM</h2>
        <p style="color: white; margin: 10px 20px;"> As we kicked off the week we dived straight back into JavaScript,
            we got introduced to JSDOM and learned its different methods.
            We put our learning into practice by building projects like a drum kit
            and a keycode generator. These projects allowed us to implement our knowledge of
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, bringing everything together for hands-on experience.
            In addition to our frontend work, we also explored backend development.
            We studied different database types like many-to-many relationships and learned
            their pros and cons. To tackle these challenges, we focused on more efficient
            models like the one-to-many setup. We also covered normalization from 1NF to 3NF,
            using primary and foreign keys to connect data.</p>

                <p style="color: snow; text-align: left;">
                    While building this project I encountered many obstacles and found them difficult to
                    overcome. However I used resources online to help me fix them. One of the obstacles I couldn't
                    figure out was why the sound wasn't working when I included the src for the audio's. After
                    researching
                    for an hour i figured out it was because I used the wrong get element in the script.JS file.
                    To enhance on my design of the drumkit I searched different CSS elemtns I could use to make it look
                    more appealing and I also followed some youtube tutorials to see how I could use them. </p>

            <div id="discoveredweekthree">
                <h3 style="color: white; text-align: center;"><u>What I discovered...</u></h3>
                <p style="color: white; text-align: center;">
                    I began to grasp the idea of margins and the use of them to space things out. I also
                    learned how to apply other CSS components, such as border-radius. Using these and a whole
                    lot more, the designs of my buttons looked much better than the default design.
                    JavaScript has always been a little difficult for me but doing this project allowed
                    me to apply the knowledge I had learnt and understand each line of code that I wrote.
                    I understood how to use addEventListeners and using the internet learned how to use the
                    keydown eventListener.
