            <p style="color: white;margin: 10px 20px;"><b>My name is Aliyah, Im 21 years old and aspire to
                    become a software developer.
                    My fascination with technology led me to explore coding as a career option,
                    drawn to the concepts of creating websites, apps, and games. The idea of bringing
                    digital ideas to life ignited a passion within me to learn the mechanics behind
                    these innovations. With each line of code, I found myself immersed in a
                    world of endless possibilities and creativity.
                    In my free time, I taught myself coding by following online tutorials and following lessons
                    on website's such as freeCodeCamp and Sololearn.
                    Joining a coding bootcamp gave me structured learning and fueled my passion for coding
                    even more. I was amazed by the many tools available in different programming languages,
                    which allowed me to create all sorts of cool stuff. Building projects in the bootcamp
                    helped me show off what I could do, and working with others made the experience even better.
                    Now, I love exploring new coding languages and tools, always excited to see what I can
                    create next and how it can make a difference.</b></p>

                    In my free time, I have a few hobbies that keep me busy and happy.
                    I love playing video games, where I can go on adventures and strategize
                    in different worlds. I also enjoy staying active by going to the gym
                    or exploring nature through hiking and running. Working out not only
                    keeps me fit but also helps me feel focused and healthy. When I want to relax,
                    I like to curl up with a good book and get lost in its stories, which always
                    sparks my imagination. </b></p>
